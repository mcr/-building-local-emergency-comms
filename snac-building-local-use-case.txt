1.  Introduction

   XXX - Intra-Gateway or Inter-Gateway?

   This document describes a scenario where gateway to gateway discovery
   is needed in order to maintain a series of building safety systems.

   New Buildings are being built with digitally controlled automation,
   and existing buildings are being retrofitted with new automation
   systems.  While some buildings can and do leverage legacy wiring
   systems such as BACnet, and able to deploy technology like [RFC8163]
   to turn existing twisted pair control systems into IPv6 networks,
   other buildings are using various combinations of 802.15.4, Powerline
   ethernet, etc.  as an alternative to explicit wiring.

   Whether wired or wireless passing of a signal through re-inforced
   concrete floors presents a challenge, particularly in the retrofit
   situation.

1.1.  Building Network Topology

   The sheer height of many buildings means that even per-floor gateways
   may be more than 100m away from the control room.  The distance issue
   requires that fiber be used to connect the building, or that sub-
   control rooms be established at regular intervals.

   As an alternative to this resulting star topology, with many critical
   points, a daisy-chain topology can be established, where the gateways
   on adjacent floors (or areas) are directly connected.  To provide
   redundancy an additional cable can connect alternating floors,
   ideally via a different conduit.  A routing protocol such as
   [RFC6550] can be used, or a metro-ethernet topology can be used to
   connect the gateways.

   This deals with the Layer 1 and Layer 2 resiliency in face of
   destruction of the control room, or the conduits leading to the
   control room.  But what about the resiliency at layer 4 and at the
   application layer?  Regulations often say that when a smoke detector
   goes on in one area that some or all adjacent areas need also to
   signal for occupants to leave.  Emergency doors and stairwells need
   to be unlocked, emergency lighting and communications systems
   activated.

1.2.  Scope of problem

   Many industrial settings can assume a competent operator to plan and
   manage the network.  On the other hand, the HOMENET problem
   description assumes that there is no such operator [RFC7368].

   In the building case there is a hybrid situation.  For most of the
   regular, boring operation of the building there is a central point of
   control, a human operator is reachable, and maintenance people or
   processes can be deployed.

   It is during an emergency that the problems arise.  The central point
   of control and the humans involved may become unavailable due to
   network partition, or because there are other things occupying their
   attention [diehard]

   This document presents the problem of having (network) adjacent
   gateways being able discover each other and interoperate with each
   other's sensor network from a just powered on situation.

   A key point about the just powered-on situation is that it assumes
   that any mesh network (whether [RFC6550] or Metro-Ring) may not have
   formed yet, and may never form.

   A network forming with [RFC6550] would normally do address assignment
   from the PIOs contained in the DODAGs.  For stability, resiliency,
   and ease of deployment, the Gateway devices would likely number their
   sensors using either a ULA locally generated, or via an IPv6 prefix
   allocated via DHCPv6-PD using an extremely long (essentially
   infinite) lifetime.

   The Gateways could advertise their prefixes into a [RFC6550] mesh
   using DAO messages.  (On a network built using a metro-ring protocol,
   then the entire gateway network is a single L2 domain, and a single
   OSPF area could be created)

   [RFC6550] includes support for non-Grounded DODAGs (no DODAG root)
   which would permit adjacent nodes to communicate and form a DAG, it
   is unclear yet if that mechanism can be used.
